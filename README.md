# Intelligent-Chatbot-with-Context-Memory

Intelligent Chatbot with Context Memory

Overview
This project implements an Intelligent Chatbot designed to understand and respond to user inputs with contextual awareness. The chatbot uses natural language processing (NLP) techniques combined with machine learning models to classify user intents, analyze emotional tone, and generate relevant responses.

The system is built on a large simulated conversational dataset, enriched with user and session metadata, emotional and topical context, and includes robust text preprocessing to improve understanding. It integrates classical NLP pipelines with multiple machine learning classifiers to optimize intent recognition.



Features
Large-scale Conversational Dataset Simulation:
Generates a dataset of 50,000 conversational prompts and responses enriched with user/session IDs, emotion labels (happy, sad, neutral), topic categories (school, weather, relationships, general), and intent classes (greeting, question, statement).



Advanced Text Preprocessing:
Cleans user prompts by removing noise, applying lemmatization, and filtering out common stopwords to enhance model accuracy.

Exploratory Data Analysis & Visualization:
Multiple visualizations to understand data distributions and relationships such as emotion distributions, topic-intent crosstabs, prompt/response length correlations, and question detection in user inputs.

Multi-Model Intent Classification Pipeline:
Implements and compares four machine learning models for intent classification:

Multinomial Naive Bayes

Logistic Regression

Random Forest Classifier

Support Vector Machine (SVM)

Each model is integrated into an end-to-end pipeline with TF-IDF vectorization for efficient text feature extraction.



Performance Evaluation:
Provides comprehensive classification reports including precision, recall, and F1-scores on unseen test data.



Technologies & Libraries
Python — Programming language

Pandas, NumPy — Data manipulation and numerical operations

NLTK — Text preprocessing (stopwords, lemmatization)

Scikit-learn — Machine learning pipelines, vectorization, classification, evaluation

Matplotlib, Seaborn — Data visualization

Project Structure
Data Loading & Simulation:
Reads conversational data from a tab-separated file, then simulates a large dataset with metadata for richer context.



Text Preprocessing Module:
Cleans and normalizes text using regex, tokenization, stopword removal, and lemmatization.



Exploratory Data Analysis:
Generates charts visualizing emotion, topic, intent distributions, text length distributions, and correlations.


Model Training & Evaluation:
Trains multiple classifiers with TF-IDF features and evaluates their performance on intent classification.
