# Intelligent-Chatbot-with-Context-Memory

🌟 Overview
This project implements an Intelligent Chatbot capable of understanding and responding to user inputs with contextual awareness. It combines Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques with machine learning models to:

Classify user intents

Analyze emotional tone

Generate contextually relevant responses

The system is built on a simulated large-scale conversational dataset, enriched with user/session metadata, emotion and topic labels, and robust preprocessing. It integrates classical NLP pipelines with a variety of machine learning models to enhance intent recognition and response quality.

🚀 Features
🗣️ Large-Scale Conversational Dataset Simulation
Generates 50,000 conversational samples.

Includes metadata such as:

User IDs, Session IDs

Emotion labels: happy, sad, neutral

Topic categories: school, weather, relationships, general

Intent classes: greeting, question, statement

 Advanced Text Preprocessing
Cleans input text by:

Removing noise & stopwords

Applying lemmatization

Normalizing text for improved feature quality

📊 Exploratory Data Analysis & Visualization
Visual insights into:

Emotion distributions

Topic-intent relationships

Text length correlations

Detection of question-based inputs

🧠 Multi-Model Intent Classification
Implements and compares multiple ML classifiers:

Multinomial Naive Bayes

Logistic Regression

Random Forest Classifier

Support Vector Machine (SVM)

All models are embedded in TF-IDF + ML pipelines for optimal performance.
